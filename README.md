## Text-expander

A bare-bones proof-of-concept implementation of a simple text-expander in Obsidian.

1. Uses `::` to start the trigger-sequence
2. Define your own custom trigger keyword like `foo`
3. In the editor, type `::foo` and hit ENTER to expand

Built-in is `::date` which will expand to todays date such as `Mon Nov 09 2020`
